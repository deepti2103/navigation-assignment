# Responsive Navigation Menu

This project is a simple React application demonstrating a responsive navigation menu with routing functionality. It includes smooth transitions, a collapsible menu for smaller screens, and user-friendly design features.

## ðŸ”§ Design Choices

- **React & React Router:** Used `react-router-dom` to create smooth in-app routing without full page reloads.
- **CSS Flexbox & Media Queries:** Built the layout using flexbox for alignment and media queries to handle responsiveness.
- **Custom Hamburger Toggle:** Implemented a manual `myFunction()` to toggle the responsive class and control layout change on smaller screens.
